          <li>I currently own a <strong>Vespa GTS250</strong> (modern) and <strong>Vespa PX125</strong> (2 stroke).</li>
          <li>A memorable <strong>mechanical failure</strong> story was when the fuel injector broke off my GTS250 in Mexico during a Amerivespa group ride in 2013. Luckily with the help from Tijuana police(!), I was able to get it safely towed back to San Diego to get it fixed.</li>
          <li>My most <strong>adventurous trip</strong> was riding and camping all the way up the coastal Highway 1 route from Santa Monica, CA to Vancouver, BC. It took me about 10 days.</li>
