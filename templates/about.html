            <h2>this site, By Christine Cheung</h2>
            <p><em>Born, raised, and still kickin' it in Los Angeles, CA.</em></p>
            <p>I'm usually known for developing websites, playing trombone, riding a Vespa GTS, going to concerts, listening to ska music, travelling, and getting into interesting situations. I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from the University of California, Riverside. I've been involved with a variety of environments (start-ups, universities, non-profits, interactive agencies), but currently I am now enjoying the consulting/freelancing lifestyle.</p>
