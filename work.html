      <h3>work</h3>

      <p>I am currently a front end engineer at <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov">18F</a>. I work with federal agencies to improve their digital services through user-centered design and agile practice on cross functional teams. While some projects required quarterly travel to Washington DC, I am mostly a remote worker.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Lead front end engineer for the redesigned FEC website from beta to live launch, simplifying the process of viewing and analyzing campaign finance data.
              </li>
              <li>
                Was an active participant in quartery, sprint planning, and grooming meetings to guide the team on website feature development. I helped advise on stories, groom issues, and identify blockers with the whole team.
              </li>
              <li>
                Collaborated with visual and content designers on implementing a new home page. Built out new features on the campaign finance data viewer (single-page web app with custom event handling) and fixed bugs. Maintained and wrote new JS tests as necessary.
              </li>
              <li>
                Worked on designing Django data models for custom Wagtail (CMS) pages for the team to add and manage content. Refactored Python views and implemented small features.
              </li>
              <li>
                Championed for sprints dedicated to reducing technical debt. Migrated a Flask app into the main Django project and merged shared front end styles that were previously managed in a separate npm based repo. During this process I deprecated several respositories, which reduced dependency issues and greatly simplifed the overall continuous integration and deployment process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lead efforts in refactoring SCSS files, broke out and  organized SCSS and JS files for better caching performance, updated the JS build system to use Webpack, and helped optimize npm dependencies.
              </li>
              <li>
                Built out a pattern library to document common visual and interactive components with guidance from the visual designer.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ran accessibility audits to make sure the site was accessible and 508 compliant.
              </li>
              <li>
                Mentored and paired with FEC engineers to get them up to speed on the web application. Ran workshops, led code reviews, and wrote documentation.
